General information:
====================
Klakita-E is a collection of scripts programed in Tcl/Tk to write binary code for various computer systems simply by clicking onto instruction-words, buttons and text-lines. Writing text is minimized.
It has been programmed by Uli Ender, Munich, Germany (contact: uli.ender-@-esperanto.de) 
and uses the international language Esperanto.

Klaktita-E is open software. It is released under the same license as Tcl/Tk (See licenco.txt)


How to run "Klakita E":
-----------------------
1) To use "Klakita E" you need an Tcl/Tk-interpreter on your computer. 
   (See web-page tcl.tk to get documentaion and download links for Tcl/Tk)
2) Copy all the project files an store them into a directory, where you have read/write-access.
   (e.g.:  /home/klakita-E (Linux) /storage/emulated/0/klakita-E (Android) )
3) Open a console in that directory and start "Klakita E" with  "wish 0"
   The start-screen showing the content will appear!
